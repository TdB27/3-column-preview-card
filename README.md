## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I prioritized learning flexbox for CSS Grid

### Continued development

In the future I will start studying Javascript more deeply. For this, I see that it is necessary to better study the basics of the Front-end Web and then delve into the programming logic.
